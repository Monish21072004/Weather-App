# ⚙️ **How It Works**

### 1️⃣ Weather → Environment Engine

All environmental layers (sky, clouds, fog, sun, moon, precipitation, lightning) dynamically react to:

* Weather code
* Time
* Temperature
* Wind
* AQI
* Simulation offset (Chronosphere)

### 2️⃣ Global Climate Sampling

Smart multi-zone sampling + jitter offset for natural variation.

### 3️⃣ Celestial Calculations

Lunar phase derived via synodic cycle mathematics.
Solar path generated using geometric arc mapping.

### 4️⃣ Map Rendering

Leaflet map auto-manages marker clustering & viewport fitting.
